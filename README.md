# Hospital Management System

## Overview
The **Hospital Management System** is a web-based platform designed to facilitate seamless interaction between patients and doctors. The system enables patients to schedule meetings with doctors, receive medical recommendations, and track their treatment plans. Doctors can manage appointments, take notes, and generate actionable steps using an LLM (Large Language Model).

## Features
### User Authentication
- Both **patients** and **doctors** can sign up and log in using similar details.
- Role-based access control with two roles:
  - **DOCTOR**
  - **PATIENT**

### Meeting Management
- A **patient** can create a meeting request with a doctor.
- The meeting status is initially set to `PENDING`.
- The **doctor** can update the meeting status to:
  - `ACCEPTED` (with a scheduled date and time)
  - `DECLINED`

### Post-Meeting Actions
- The **doctor** takes notes about the patient's condition.
- An **LLM** generates actionable steps for the patient based on the doctorâ€™s notes.
- The patient can optionally leave a review for the doctor.

## Actionable Steps (Example)
After a meeting, actionable steps are generated and stored in the database. Example:

```json
{
  "actionableSteps": [
    {
      "type": "Plan",
      "task": "Gargle with warm saltwater",
      "frequency": "twice daily",
      "duration": null
    },
    {
      "type": "Plan",
      "task": "Take honey and lemon tea",
      "frequency": "at night",
      "duration": null
    },
    {
      "type": "Plan",
      "task": "Monitor symptoms",
      "frequency": null,
      "duration": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **AI Integration**: LLM for generating actionable steps

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed


### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Gibril/HealthMS.git hms
   cd hms
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables (`.env` file):
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=<groq_api_key>
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   ```
4. Run database migrations:
   ```sh
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- `POST /auth/signup` - Register a new user
- `POST /auth/login` - Login and receive a JWT token

### Patient 
These are some of the actions a patient can perform. The name in brackets represents the request name in the postman documentation
- `POST /api/v1/meetings` - ( Choose Doctor) - Create a meeting request (Patient only)
- `GET /meetings/?status=<ACCEPTED/DECLINED/PENDING>` - ( Get Meetings )It returns all the meetings you have set. The query params is for filtering purposes
- `PUT /meetings/` - (Add Reviews To Meeting) - Adding reviews after a meeting has happened


### Doctor
- `GET /api/v1/doctors/meetings?status=<ACCEPTED/DECLINED/PENDING>` - (Get Invited Meetings) - It returns all the meetings a doctor has been booked for. The query params is for filtering purposes
- `PUT /api/v1/doctors/meetings/<meeting_id>/` - (Accept or Decline) - It allows the doctor to either accept or decline the meetings

### Records
- `POST /api/v1/records` - The doctor uses this endpoint to log the notes takes after a meeting. - (Add Records) - This endpoints generates actionble steps using LLM
- `POST /api/v1/records/:meetingId/` - (Get Records) - This retrieves all the notes a doctor took during the meeting and also all the actionable steps that were generated by the LLM
